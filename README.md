# Winter Break Adventure 2016-17 Edition

Repository for stuff I'm learning over winter break (December 2016-January
2017).

So far ~~(12/11)~~ (12/17) the to-do list is:
 - [ ] Haskell (small code exercises in `hello-haskell` directory)
 - [ ] Super simple "NLP" implementations (see `wannabenlp` directory)
 - [ ] Some basic ML/CV stuff (preferably with Haskell)
 - [ ] Small web-app (using a Haskell web framework)

I'll be reading *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good* (LYHGG) by Miran
Lipovaca, a book I've had sitting around for 3+ years. *Real World Haskell* 
by Bryan O'Sullivan, John Goerzen, and Don Stewart is also sitting on the
shelf and ready to go. Both seem to be go-to resources for learning Haskell.
[This StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell)
is also amazing and I'll be using that as well.

As you can see, the theme is functional and hopefully the code is as well.

Workflow will be almost entirely in terminal (ghc, ghci, vim, git, tmux).
