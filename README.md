# Winter Break Adventure 2016-17 Edition

Repository for stuff I'm learning over winter break (December 2016-January
2017).

(actively updated) todo list is:
 - [x] Haskell (small code exercises in `hello-haskell` directory)
 - [x] Super simple "NLP" implementations (see `wannabenlp` directory)
 - [x] Implementation of [Norvig's spell checker](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)
       (see `norvigspell` directory)
 - [ ] Implementation of functional code in not-Haskell (Javascript/Node.js)
       (see `fakehaskell` directory)
 - [ ] Some basic ML/CV stuff (preferably with Haskell)
 - [ ] Small web-app (using a Haskell web framework)

I'll be reading *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good* (LYHGG) by Miran
Lipovaca, a book I've had sitting around for 3+ years. *Real World Haskell* 
by Bryan O'Sullivan, John Goerzen, and Don Stewart is also sitting on the
shelf and ready to go. Both seem to be go-to resources for learning Haskell.
[This StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell)
is also amazing and I'll be using that as well.

Poking around the internet has also led me to Bartosz Milewski's amazing
blog post series (and in progress book) *[Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)*.
The Javascript code in `fakehaskell` are my implementations of topics covered
in those blog posts.

As you can see, the theme is functional and hopefully the code is as well.

Workflow will be almost entirely in terminal (ghc, ghci, vim, git, tmux).
