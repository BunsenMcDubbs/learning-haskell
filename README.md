# Adventure Winter Break 2016-17 Edition

Repository for stuff I learned over winter break (December 2016-January
2017). So far (12/11) the to-do list is:
 - [] Haskell (small code exercises in `hello-haskell` directory)
 - [] Some basic ML/CV stuff (preferably with Haskell)
 - [] Small web-app (using a Haskell web framework)

I'll be reading *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good* (LYHGG by Miran
Lipovaca, a book I've had sitting around for 3+ years. *Real World Haskell* 
by Bryan O'Sullivan, John Goerzen, and Don Stewart is also sitting on the
shelf and ready to go. Both seem to be go-to resources for learning Haskell.

As you can see, the theme is functional and hopefully the code is as well.

Workflow will be almost entirely in terminal (ghc(i), vim, git, tmux).
